# UniformCostSearch-A-Algor
Implementing UniformCostSearch/A* to solve 8-puzzle

 I want you to write a program that solves the eight
-
puzzle. You will solve it using
:
1)
Uniform Cost Search
1
2)
A* with the
Misplaced Tile heuristic.
3)
A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic.
You may use any language, but the variable and function names for main “driver” program
should
approximately
ma
tch the peusdocode in
my slides
.
If you have a good reason to ignore this dir
ective, let me
know in advance.
The general search algorithm.
I expect the code to be meaningfully commented, nicely indented etc. This is not a software
engineering
class, but if I cannot clearly review and understand your code. I will strongly lean towards a lower grade.
The code should be kept general as possible. In other words, your code should require only a modicum of
effort to
change to solve the 15
-
puzzle, or the 25
-
puzzle etc
.
You can hardcode an initial state for testing
purposes. But I want to be able to enter an arbitrary initial state. So sometime along the lines of the
interface on the next page would be nice.
You may use some predefined uti
lity routines, for example sorting routines or queue manipulation
functions. However
,
I expect all the major code to be original. You must document any book, webpage,
person or other resources you consult in doing this project (see the first day’s handout)
.
You may consult colleagues at a high level, discussing ways to implement the tree data structure for
example. But you may
not
share code. At most, you might illustrate something to a colleague with
pseudocode.
You will hand in
a
two
to five
-
page
repor
t which summaries your findings.
I have appended a sample
report to this file
.
You
must
keep the evolving versions of your code, so that, if necessary you can demonstrate to the course
staff how you went about solving this problem (in other words, we may a
sk you to prove that you did the
work, rather than copy it from somewhere).
