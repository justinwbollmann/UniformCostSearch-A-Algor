# UniformCostSearch-A-Algor
Implementing UniformCostSearch/A* to solve 8-puzzle

 I want you to write a program that solves the eight-puzzle. 
 You will solve it using:
1) Uniform Cost Search
2) A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic.
3) A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic.
You may use any language: Python for me

The general search algorithm.
I expect the code to be meaningfully commented, nicely indented etc. This is not a software
engineering
class, but if I cannot clearly review and understand your code. I will strongly lean towards a lower grade.
The code should be kept general as possible. In other words, your code should require only a modicum of effort to change to solve the 15-puzzle, or the 25-puzzle etc.

You can hardcode an initial state for testing
purposes. But I want to be able to enter an arbitrary initial state. So sometime along the lines of the interface on the next page would be nice.
You may use some predefined utility routines, for example sorting routines or queue manipulation functions. 

You may consult colleagues at a high level, discussing ways to implement the tree data structure for example. You will hand in a two to five-page report which summaries your findings.

You must keep the evolving versions of your code, so that, if necessary you can demonstrate to the course staff how you went about solving this problem
